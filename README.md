<h1>Hello! Welcome to my GitHub!</h1> 
 
 👋 Hi, I’m @tagutirayane, I am graduated in Cinema and I work in the Production of Brazilian movies and series.

 👀 In addition to being an artsy person, a huge part of my heart admires numbers and logic since little age.
 I'm seeing web development as a union of my two favorite worlds.

 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development.
 I have some knowledge in HTML5, CSS3 and I'm starting to learn JAVA.

 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front-end projects or to take part in courses that can help me increase my knowledge.

 📫 E-mail me: rayanetagutig@gmail.com
